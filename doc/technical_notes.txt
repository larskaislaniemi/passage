# Storage format

Dir per secret:

	DIR	<secretname>.pasg
	- FILE	secret    	encrypted secret content
	- FILE	recips    	keys to whom the secret has been encrypted
	- FILE	recips.sig	signature of FILE recips

Signature by `ssh-keygen -Y sign`. Encryption by `age -R recips`.


# Operations

Atomic operations:
 - Encrypt a secret <- (secretname, recipients, secret-content)
 - Show a secret <- (secretname)
 - Show recipients of a secret <- (secretname)

Combinations:
 - Modify secret-content, update secret-content
 - Modify recipients, update recipients
 - Add recipients from file (TODO)
	- Replace recipients from file = update-recipients < file-with-ssh-pubkeys
 - Copy list of recipients from another secret (TODO)

Other operations:
 - List secrets


# Issues

- FIXED update-recipients: malformed recipients content -> encryption fails -> future decrypts will fail
- public key location required even if private key is known -- fix by calculating pub from priv
- FIXED remove dependency on /dev/shm, don't write plain secrets to files; use default tmpdir
